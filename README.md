# Airline-Passenger-Time-Series-Forecasting

`An airline company has the data on the number of passengers that have travelled with them on a particular route for the past few years. Using this data, they want to see if they can forecast the number of passengers for the next twelve months.`
 

Making this forecast could be quite beneficial to the company as it would help them take some crucial decisions like - 

- What capacity aircraft should they use?
- When should they fly?
- How many air hostesses and pilots do they need?
- How much food should they stock in their inventory?
